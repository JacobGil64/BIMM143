[Q1] Tell me the name of a protein you are interested in. Include the species and the accession
number. This can be a human protein or a protein from any other species as long as it's function
is known.
If you do not have a favorite protein, select human RBP4 or KIF11. Do not use beta globin as
this is in the worked example report that I provide you with online.

Name: RBP4
Accession: P02753.3
Species: Homo Sapiens


[Q2] Perform a BLAST search against a DNA database, such as a database consisting of
genomic DNA or ESTs. The BLAST server can be at NCBI or elsewhere. Include details of the
BLAST method used, database searched and any limits applied (e.g. Organism).

Method: TBLASTN (2.7.1) search against nematode ESTs
Database: Nucleotide collection (nt)
Organism: Homo sapiens (taxid:9606)
