>Q13: Read this file into R and determine the sample size for each genotype and their
corresponding median expression levels for each of these genotypes.

```{r}
expr <- read.table("rs8067378_ENSG00000172057.6.txt")
#head(expr)

nrow(expr)
```
```{r}
table(expr$geno)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(expr) + aes(geno, exp, fill = geno) + geom_boxplot(notch=TRUE)
```
>Q14: Generate a boxplot with a box per genotype, what could you infer from the relative
expression value between A/A and G/G displayed in this plot? Does the SNP effect the
expression of ORMDL3?

A|A is more common. yes the snp affects expression.
