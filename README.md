bioinformatics class
This repo is for my UCSD bioinformatics class. 

I was absent for class this past thursday and I was unable to find information on the class site (one of the youtube links expired and the lecture slides were somewhat outdated with the setup process) that showed how I could add my R projects to my pages site. All of my projects are in my github but only the readme showed up when I published the site.
